# Impasta Rosta Pitch

Last month, I wanted to get something to eat, and my refrigerator looked something like this.

One month later, all that frozen food is gone and chicken is now my most hated meal. That being said, I still can’t cook, and I have no clue how to even start. That is why our team is making Impasta Rosta.

## The Problem

Food. We all eat it. And yet, not all of us know how to make it. According to the US Department of Agriculture, millennials like us consume food from a restaurant 30% more than any other generation. It makes sense: less dishes, less work, more time to do other things. But when our most convenient option for food as college students is most likely McDonalds, or any other fast food restaurant, it becomes clear that eating out is not the most sustainable option. However, learning to cook isn’t the easiest thing to do either. It requires tools and experience. A lot of it. And so, we have Impasta Rosta.
