# Impasta Rosta Pitch

Last month, I wanted to get something to eat, and my refrigerator looked something like this.

One month later, all that frozen food is gone and chicken is now my most hated meal. That being said, I still can’t cook, and I have no clue how to even start. That is why our team is making Impasta Rosta.

## The Problem

Food. We all eat it. And yet, not all of us know how to make it. According to the US Department of Agriculture, millennials like us consume food from a restaurant 30% more than any other generation. It makes sense: less dishes, less work, more time to do other things. But when our most convenient option for food as college students is most likely McDonalds, or any other fast food restaurant, it becomes clear that eating out is not the most sustainable option. However, learning to cook isn’t the easiest thing to do either. It requires tools and experience. A lot of it. And so, we have Impasta Rosta.

## Out Target Audience

From our original problem statement, it would seem obvious to gear our application towards young adults with little to no cooking experience. However, we decided to generalize our audience to all beginner cooks, which could range from people with zero cooking knowledge to amateur cooks. Since many members of our team are beginner cooks as well, it will be easier for us to understand the perspective of our users, and we can draw from our own cooking experiences when designing the application. Aside from young adult cooks, we are also considering middle aged cooks

and elderly cooks

By considering beginner cooks from various age groups, we are also looking to design the application in such a way that it accommodates differing levels of technology experience. That way, our application will feel beginner friendly as well as being geared towards beginners.
