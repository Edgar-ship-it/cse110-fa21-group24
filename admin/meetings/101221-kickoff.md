  3. Issues are assigned by project managers during the weekly iteration meeting
  4. Create a new branch for each issue you are working on
  5. When pushing work to GitHub repository, push to a remote version of your issue branch, do not push to `main` branch
  6. After pushing to GitHub, open a pull request to merge the issue branch into the `main` branch
  7. Link issue(s) to pull request (the pull request template will have a section to link issues)
  8. Each pull request requires two approving reviews from two other team members before the pull request can be ready to merge
  9. When the pull request has two approvals, label the pull request with the `ready to merge` label
  10. The project managers will take care of the actual merging of the issue branches
- Team iteration meetings
  - In the start of the meeting, the team will go over the issues from the previous week and clean up the project board
  - Afterwards, we will have a retrospective, where we discuss what went well, what did not go well, and what we need to change (the good, the bad, the ugly)
  - In last part of the meeting, the project managers will explain the new issues in the backlog and assign issues to members
    - Issues will have detailed descriptions and will be pointed from 1 to 3, with 1 being the least work and 3 being the most work
  - After the iteration meeting, members can message a specific channel for followup questions and feedback about issues and their proposed solutions to the issues
    - This channel will be created in the future
- Went over the contract guidelines that the Monday kickoff group established, everyone agreed with the current rules
- The Impastas was well received by the team and will likely be our team name
- Edgar will take care of the team video
