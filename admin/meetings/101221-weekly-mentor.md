### Meeting Notes
- Communication, constructive feedback, honesty, fair conflict resolution, willingness to help, compromise, cooperation, understanding everyone's strengths and weaknesses are all important aspects of a good team
- Weekly mentor meetings are good for asking for feedback and asking questions from the mentor
- Have at least one internal team meeting each week, might be on the weekend since that is the time when most of the team is available
- Have open communication when resolving conflicts and creative conflicts
- Roles should be flexible
  - Roles are meant to place an emphasis on who works on what, eut everyone understands a bit about and is involved in every part of the project
- Split group tasks between members, so that work is not concentrated with only a few people
