  Hi, my name is Grant and I am a third year Math-Computer Science major. I find creating things to be extremely fun and I can't wait to make a project with all of my team members! Some of my favorite things to do when I'm not coding are chess, video games, and singing. [Here](https://grantduntugan.github.io/GitHub-Pages/) you can find my personal page.

  Hello! My name is Minh and I'm a third year Computer Engineering major. I think this class is going to be very interesting since this will be the first time that I'll create a fully functional application from scratch. Some of my favorite hobbies are weight lifting, basketball, and playing video games. A link to my personal GitHub page can be found [here](https://minhdinh901.github.io/GitHub-Pages-Project/).
